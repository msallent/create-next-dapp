# create-next-dapp

**`create-next-dapp`** is a template repository to quickly spin up a dapp with Next.js and Hardhat. TypeScript, along other development libraries such as ESLint, Prettier, husky, solhint and lint-staged are all already installed and set up.

Following Hardhat's recommendations, Ethers is used to interact with our contracts, and Mocha, along Chai and Waffle are used for testing.

For styling the frontend, tailwindcss is the library of choice.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Start by installing dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the JSON-RPC server so that we can deploy the contract and connect to MetaMask:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Open a new terminal and deploy the contract. Save the address it deployed to as it'll be needed to interact with the contract from within `src/pages/index.tsx`

```bash
npx hardhat run src/scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```

Finally, run the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

By default Next.js supports reading environment variables from a `.env.local` file so we're going to use the same file to feed anything necessary to Hardhat.

```bash
# Easily connect to any network using alchemy.com or infura.io
# As an example we'll be using Kovan, but any other or even multiple networks could be used

KOVAN_ENDPOINT=

# Account to be used by Hardhat to make the deployment
# Because we're deploying to the Kovan testnet, we need an account from the same network
# You can export your private key from within the MetaMask extension

# If present, gas usage will be reported for each unit test
# CoinMarketCap API key can be provided to fetch current market price data
