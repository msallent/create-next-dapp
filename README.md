**`create-next-dapp`** is a template repository to quickly spin up a dapp with Next.js and Hardhat. TypeScript, along other development libraries such as ESLint, Prettier, husky, solhint and lint-staged are all already installed and set up.

Following Hardhat's recommendations, Ethers is used to interact with our contracts, and Mocha, along Chai and Waffle are used for testing.

For styling the frontend, nothing comes installed by default, giving freedom to the user to choose what they prefer.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
